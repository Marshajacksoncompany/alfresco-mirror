BUILD

"mvn install" should build the wcmqs.war file.

The project contains a snapshot of Spring Surf and Open CMIS in a local maven repository. These were 
built from the source and then the relevant directories within the $HOME/.m2 maven repository copied 
under the project repo in maven-repo. 

INSTALLATION

If the wcmqs.war is deployed to a different servlet container to the Alfresco repository then the web
editor application needs to be deployed with it. This can be found as the awe.war file under directory webeditor.
